        <h1>Elasticsearch settings</h1>
        
        <p class="lead">Hi! This is a proof-of-concept to explore the concept of "code as data". Your codebase could tell you <em>so much</em> only if it was easier to get at. It's generally talked about in abstract terms, but I had a specific problem.</p>
        <p>Elasticsearch is a piece of software with a lot of different settings you can tweak and the documentation is pretty good <em>if</em> you know what to look for. As someone operating a cluster, there is no one place that lists all the settings! I wanted to compile a full list of Elasticsearch settings to have a quick lookup and to help discover settings I didn't know about or might even be undocumented.</p>
        <p>So, I used <a href="https://bblf.sh">bblfsh</a> to analyze the entire Elasticsearch codebase and get <strong>all</strong> the settings. <a href="https://github.com/nickcanz/elasticsearch-bblfsh">Take a look at the code!</a> This project was done as an experiment and I currently don't plan on investing a ton of time into it, but if you see any issues or want to help out, please open an issue on the repository.</p>
