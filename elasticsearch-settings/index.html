    <h1>Elasticsearch settings</h1>
    <p>Hi! This is a proof-of-concept to explore the concept "code as data". Your codebase could tell you <em>so much</em> only if it was easier to get at.</p>
    <p>Elasticsearch is a piece of software with a lot of different settings you can tweak, but there is no one place that lists them all. I wanted to compile a full list of Elasticsearch settings. The Elasticsearch docs are great, but all the configurable settings are spread out over many different pages.</p>
    <p>So, I used <a href="https://bblf.sh">bblfsh</a> to analyze the entire Elasticsearch codebase and get <strong>all</strong> the settings. <a href="https://github.com/nickcanz/elasticsearch-bblfsh">Take a look at the code!</a> It's definitely not perfect, but it's a good enough proof-of-concept to explore the idea.</p>
