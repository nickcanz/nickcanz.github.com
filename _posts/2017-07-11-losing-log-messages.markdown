My style of learning and working has gotten me to the point where I have pretty _wide_ knowledge of various computering stuff, but not deep knowledge. I've bounced around between .NET vs Ruby vs Clojure, Windows vs Linux, colo vs cloud. This means that as I debug problems, I often run head-long into various pits that I didn't even know were there. Linux logging is one of those pits that I just had no idea how it worked...
