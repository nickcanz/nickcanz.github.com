  <h3><a href="https://nickcanzoneri.com/elasticsearch-settings">Elasticsearch settings code analysis</a></h3>
  <p>I explored analyzing the Elasticsearch codebase to find all of the configurable setting values to put them all in one place. Code to generate the list is found in the <a href="https://github.com/nickcanz/elasticsearch-bblfsh">elasticsearch-bblfsh repo</a>.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://nickcanzoneri.com/places">Places</a></h3>
  <p>I made a JS map thing that lets you search for a place name and see where it (and other similar names) are located in the US. I like finding the outliers. <a href="https://nickcanzoneri.com/places/#beach">Like Beach, North Dakota</a>.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/nickcanz/revere-extension">Revere Chrome extension</a></h3>
  <p>I had a problem of following different provider's status pages for updates when they post issues. This Chrome extension periodically checks RSS feeds and pops a notification when it detects a new entry to alert you.</p>
